# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to make step by step changes to our code. Its useful in that if you find out you have a bug in your code, you can go back to a previous version and work from there to fix it, as you know (should hopefully) know where the bug came in
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
branches allow you to make changes to the code without it being inserted into main code. this way your update doesnt have to be added, or "merged," until youre ready for it to be
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
commit is a save point that you can go back to if you have a problem later on. a good commit message will have detail to let you know what you did, and is understandable to others that may view it too
* What is a merge conflict?
a merge conflict happens when your commits do not match up to the commits in the branch youre trying to merge with, meaning they dont line up correctly and cannot be brought together

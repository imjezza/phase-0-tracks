					Yep, thats right, were talking about <strong>hummus</strong> on this page. That beautiful mix of chickpeas and <em>tahini</em>, probably some garlic, definitely some oil and likely some roasted red pepper that we all know and love. heat up your pitas, rip off a chunk, and scoop yourself up some of that delicious <strong>hummus</strong> goodness.

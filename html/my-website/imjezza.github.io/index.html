<h1>Well, So What IS A Pizza?</h1>
<p>Let's get this out of the way to start out with: Pizza Is A Sandwhich. You may be confused at first but it is indeed an open faced sandwhich. Anyways, pizza is generally a bread base, your "crust," normally covered with a sauce, various toppings ranging from corn to pepperonis, and cheese. Once assembled, these items are placed on a pan of some sort into a hot oven, and in a few moments you can remove it, slice it up and enjoy a nice, hot sandwich.</p>

<div>
	<h2>Alright now lets make one</h2>
<p>First things first, we need our crust. These can be made from cauliflower, naan, heck even portabella mushrooms, but we're going with a basic thin crust today. Here's what you'll need.</p>

<h3>Ok, Moving On...</h3>
<p>Toppings. There <em>hang on one moment go preheat your oven to 450F before you read further here</em> are literally more than I could ever list here because you can put nearly anything on a pizza, besides pineapple and canadian bacon together. No, Don't. So this I'll leave mostly up to your imagination, but what we basically need to have is a <em>Sauce</em>, which is usually tomato based but I will be using a basil pesto, our <em>Toppings</em>, for which I've chosen red onions and mushrooms, and some <em>Cheese</em>, which is most often mozzerella and parmesan, which i will be using along with some meunster. Lets go.</p>
<ul>
	<li>First you're gonna spread your sauce. Go light! It should or nearly should cover all of your dough besides a border left around the whole edge, but it doesn't need to be a swamp, only a puddle.</li>
	<li>Now you can spread your toppings. Some do cheese first, and this is ok, but I'm not some I'm Jeremy. So spread them around. Don't pile them on one another, pre cook things like mushrooms and maybe bell peppers, and be creative with what you use.</li>
	<li>Shred or slice your cheese, and lay it on top of what youve done so far. Watch the edges of the pizza, you dont need them to burn cheese off the side, and remember again, not too thick buddy.</li>
	<li>Pop your 'za in the oven for about 15 minutes and pull it out when its done. You'll know, and don't burn the cheese. Let Cool Slightly, and then slice and enjoy!</li>
	<li>Turn your oven off and do the dishes. Yea, you gotta</li>
</ul>
